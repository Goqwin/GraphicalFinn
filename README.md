# GraphicalFinn
An old Assignment in my First Year of Programming at UofC.

Part 1: Creating a Graphical Python Program
In this part of the assignment, you will create a small graphical Python program. The program will take 
two integers as input from the user. Its output will be a “smiley” (loosely defined) centered on the 
position specified by the user. For example, if the user enters 400 and 300 as input then the face should 
be centered in the window. If the user enters 0 and 0 then the face should be centered in the upper left 
corner of the window, with part of it cut off by the edge of the window. Use the SimpleGraphics library 
that you were introduced to previously to complete this task.


Use x = 0 and y = 0 for accurate image of Finn
